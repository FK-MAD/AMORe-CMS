All MATLAB code written for my diploma thesis on Component Mode Synthesis (CMS):

"Advanced Model Reduction Techniques for Structural Dynamics Simulations", Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Thessaly 

The code is compatible with FE models created with COMSOL Multiphysics. MATLAB must be started with COMSOL server (using LiveLink).
In the future, a user guide might be written.
